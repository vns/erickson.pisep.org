In July 2019 we had [Richard Hill](https://www.richardhill.com.au/) in Sofia present Mirroring Hands, a therapeutic technique
Richard has written about with his mentor Ernest Rossi. More than simply a technique, it offers somatic insight into non-conscious states
and is based on earlier work by Ernest Rossi and Milton Erickson.

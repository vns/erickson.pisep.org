The Milton H. Erickson Institute of Sofia was established in 1994 after an
inspiring encounter and training with Jeffrey Zeig, PhD, founder and director
of the Milton H. Erickson Foundation, Pheonix, AZ, USA. Functioning under the
auspices of The Psychotherapeutic Institute for the Social Ecology of
Personality ([PISEP](http://pisep.org)), it is authorized by the Milton H.
Erickson Foundation to conduct trainings, therapy and research based on the
ideas and contributions of Milton H. Erickson, MD.

The primary focus in the development of the institute has been the integration
of Ericksonian approaches to therapy in other therapeutic modalities such as
art therapy, psychodrama, family therapy and others. The therapeutic practice
of the institute consists of clinical problems such as phobias, depression,
anxiety, panic attacks, OCDs, addictions and others.

The institute has conducted its trainings in the forms of workshops and courses
as part of the training programmes of PISEP for counsellors and
psychotherapists.

In 2004, the Milton H. Erickson Institute in partnership with a group of German
artists completed a project named "Sofia: a city in transition â€“ past, present and future".
It was based on the approach of Erickson and methods of art therapy,
internactional group therapy and guided imagination. It was exhibited both in
Berlin and Sofia and attracted a significant public attention.

After the visit of Jeffrey Zeig, a significant milestone in the development of the
institute is marked by the visit of Ernest Rossi, PhD in 1999. After that followed more
visits of Dr. Zeig, a training conducted by Dr. Liliana Cane, PhD, the director
of the Milton H. Erickson Institute of Montreal, Kaloyan S. Tanev, MD, President of
the New England Association of Hypnosis, USA.

The instiute developed the GIFT method (group interaction-focused therapy) integrating
techniques from art therapy, music therapy, ericksonian hypnosis, brief therapy, CBT
and process work. The method is used both for therapy and in the trainings for psychotherapists.
